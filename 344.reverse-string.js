 * Testcase Example:  '["h","e","l","l","o"]'
 *
 * Write a function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an
 * array of characters s.
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 * Input: s = ["h","e","l","l","o"]
 * Output: ["o","l","l","e","h"]
 * Example 2:
 * Input: s = ["H","a","n","n","a","h"]
 * Output: ["h","a","n","n","a","H"]
 *
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 *
 * 1 <= s.length <= 10^5
 * s[i] is a printable ascii character.
 *
 *
 *
 * Follow up: Do not allocate extra space for another array. You must do this
 * by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.
